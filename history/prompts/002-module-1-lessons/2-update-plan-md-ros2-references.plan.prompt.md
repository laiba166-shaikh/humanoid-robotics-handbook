## Prompt
mention in plan.md that during research refer the official ros2 https://docs.ros.org/, https://design.ros2.org/

## Response
I have updated `plan.md` to include a note in the "Phase 0: Content Research" section, instructing to refer to the official ROS 2 documentation at `https://docs.ros.org/` and `https://design.ros2.org/`.

Now I will create a Prompt History Record for this interaction.
