## Chapter Overview

Gazebo is the industry-standard robotics simulator, used by everyone from hobbyists to NASA. It provides accurate physics simulation, sensor modeling, and seamless ROS 2 integration.

## Learning Objectives

- **Install** and configure Gazebo on Ubuntu 22.04
- **Create** simulation worlds with objects and terrain
- **Import** robot models from URDF/SDF
- **Simulate** physics (gravity, collisions, friction)
- **Add** virtual sensors to your robot
