# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Focus**: Physics simulation and environment building
**Duration**: Weeks 6-7 (2 weeks)
**Hardware Tier**: Tier 2 (RTX GPU recommended)

:::note Coming Soon
This module is currently in outline form. Full content will be available in a future update.
:::

## Module Overview

Before deploying code to a physical robot, we test it in simulation. A **Digital Twin** is a virtual replica of your robot that behaves according to real physics - gravity, friction, collisions, and sensor noise.

In this module, you'll master Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Set up** Gazebo simulation environments for robot testing
- **Create** robot models using URDF and SDF formats
- **Simulate** physics including gravity, collisions, and friction
- **Configure** virtual sensors (LIDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- **Build** high-fidelity visualizations in Unity
- **Design** human-robot interaction scenarios

## Prerequisites

- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - completed
- Basic 3D graphics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble

## Hardware Requirements

| Tier | Equipment | What You Can Do |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1** | Laptop + Cloud | AWS RoboMaker, limited local Gazebo |
| **Tier 2** | RTX GPU + Ubuntu | Full Gazebo simulation, Unity rendering |
