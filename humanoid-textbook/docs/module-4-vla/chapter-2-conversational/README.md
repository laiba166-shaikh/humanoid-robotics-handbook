# Chapter 2: Conversational Robotics

**Duration**: Week 13
**Hardware Tier**: Tier 2-3
**Lessons**: 4

:::note Coming Soon
This chapter is currently in outline form. Full content will be available in a future update.

## Chapter Overview

"Clean the room." Four syllables that require understanding intent, decomposing into subtasks, perceiving the environment, and executing dozens of coordinated actions. This chapter teaches you how to build robots that understand and act on natural language.

## Learning Objectives

- **Integrate** OpenAI Whisper for voice command processing
- **Build** speech recognition and NLU pipelines
- **Design** multi-modal interaction systems
- **Use** LLMs for cognitive planning and task decomposition
