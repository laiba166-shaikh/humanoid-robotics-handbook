# Chapter 3: Capstone Project

**Duration**: Final Week
**Hardware Tier**: Tier 2-4
**Lessons**: 3

:::note Coming Soon
This chapter is currently in outline form. Full content will be available in a future update.
:::

## Chapter Overview

Everything you've learned comes together in the Autonomous Humanoid capstone project. You'll build a complete system that receives voice commands, plans actions, navigates environments, and manipulates objects.

## Learning Objectives

- **Architect** a complete VLA robot system
- **Integrate** all modules (ROS 2, simulation, perception, planning)
- **Implement** the full voice-to-action pipeline
- **Demonstrate** autonomous humanoid behavior

## Lessons (Outline)

| # | Lesson | Duration | Status |
|---|--------|----------|--------|
| 3.1 | The Autonomous Humanoid Specification | 60 min | 📝 Outline |
| 3.2 | Implementation Guide | 120 min | 📝 Outline |
| 3.3 | Evaluation and Next Steps | 45 min | 📝 Outline |

## Capstone Requirements

### Minimum Viable Project
- [ ] Voice command input (Whisper)
- [ ] LLM-based task planning
- [ ] Navigation to target
- [ ] Object detection
- [ ] Basic manipulation

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation
- [ ] Error recovery and replanning
- [ ] Learning from demonstration
- [ ] Real robot deployment (Tier 4)

## Evaluation Rubric

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| System Architecture | 20 |
| Voice Integration | 15 |
| Navigation | 20 |
| Manipulation | 20 |
| LLM Planning | 15 |
| Demo Quality | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

## What's Next?

Completing this capstone prepares you for:
- Research in embodied AI
- Robotics engineering roles
- Humanoid robot startup opportunities
- Advanced NVIDIA certifications
