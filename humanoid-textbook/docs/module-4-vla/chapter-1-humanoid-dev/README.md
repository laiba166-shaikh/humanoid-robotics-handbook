## Chapter Overview

Humanoid robots present unique challenges: bipedal balance, coordinated arm movement, and human-like interaction. This chapter covers the fundamentals of humanoid kinematics and control.

## Learning Objectives

- **Model** humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics
- **Implement** bipedal locomotion and balance control
- **Design** manipulation strategies for humanoid hands
- **Create** natural human-robot interaction patterns
