# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Focus**: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics
**Duration**: Weeks 11-13 (3 weeks)
**Hardware Tier**: Tier 2-4

:::note Coming Soon
This module is currently in outline form. Full content will be available in a future update.

## Module Overview

This is where everything comes together. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent the cutting edge of robotics: robots that can see, understand natural language, and act in the physical world.

Tell your robot "Clean the room" and watch it plan a path, navigate obstacles, identify objects, and manipulate them - all from a single voice command.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Integrate** OpenAI Whisper for voice-to-text commands
- **Design** cognitive planning systems using LLMs
- **Build** multi-modal interaction (speech, gesture, vision)
- **Create** action sequences from natural language
- **Complete** the Autonomous Humanoid capstone project

## Prerequisites

- Modules 1-3 completed
- Understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering
- Python async programming

## Hardware Requirements

| Tier | Equipment | What You Can Do |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Tier 2** | RTX GPU | Full VLA pipeline in simulation |
| **Tier 3** | Jetson + Sensors | Real-world voice commands |
| **Tier 4** | Physical Robot | Complete autonomous humanoid |

## Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

Build a simulated humanoid robot that:

1. **Receives** a voice command ("Pick up the red cup")
2. **Plans** a sequence of actions using an LLM
3. **Navigates** to the target location avoiding obstacles
4. **Identifies** the target object using computer vision
5. **Manipulates** the object (grasping, moving)
6. **Reports** completion back to the user

This is Physical AI in action - the future of human-robot collaboration.
