## Chapter Overview

The ultimate goal: deploy your trained models to real robots. This chapter covers Nav2 path planning adapted for bipedal humanoids, sim-to-real transfer techniques, and deployment to Jetson edge devices.

## Learning Objectives

- **Configure** Nav2 for bipedal robot navigation
- **Apply** sim-to-real transfer techniques
- **Deploy** models to Jetson Orin devices
- **Handle** real-world uncertainty and noise
