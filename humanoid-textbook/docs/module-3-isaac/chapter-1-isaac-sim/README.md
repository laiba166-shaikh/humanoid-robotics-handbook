## Chapter Overview

Isaac Sim, built on NVIDIA Omniverse, provides photorealistic simulation that's indistinguishable from reality. This enables training perception models on synthetic data and testing robot behaviors in diverse scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

- **Install** and configure Isaac Sim on an RTX workstation
- **Navigate** the Omniverse interface and USD scene format
- **Import** robot models into Isaac Sim
- **Generate** synthetic training data with domain randomization
