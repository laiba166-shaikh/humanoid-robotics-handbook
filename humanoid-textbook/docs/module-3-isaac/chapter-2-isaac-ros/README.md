## Chapter Overview

Isaac ROS brings GPU-accelerated perception to ROS 2. Run VSLAM, object detection, and 3D reconstruction at unprecedented speeds using NVIDIA's optimized libraries.

## Learning Objectives

- **Implement** hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM
- **Deploy** perception models using Isaac ROS
- **Apply** reinforcement learning for robot control
- **Integrate** Isaac ROS with existing ROS 2 systems
