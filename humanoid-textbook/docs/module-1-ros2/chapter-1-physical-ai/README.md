# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

**Duration**: Weeks 1-2
**Hardware Tier**: Tier 1 (Cloud compatible)
**Lessons**: 4

## Chapter Overview

Before we write our first line of robot code, we need to understand a fundamental shift happening in AI: the move from purely digital intelligence to **Physical AI** - AI systems that exist in and interact with the real world.

ChatGPT can write poetry, but it can't pick up a cup of coffee. This chapter explores why that's changing and what it means for the future of robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Define** Physical AI and explain how it differs from digital-only AI
- **Identify** the three core components of embodied intelligence
- **Describe** the current humanoid robotics landscape and key players
- **Explain** how different sensors (LIDAR, cameras, IMUs) enable robot perception
- **Articulate** why humanoid form factors are advantageous in human environments

## Prerequisites

- None - this is the first chapter!
- Curiosity about robotics and AI

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | Duration | Tier | Description |
|---|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| 1.1 | [Foundations of Physical AI](./lesson-1-foundations.md) | 45 min | 1 | What is Physical AI and why it matters |
| 1.2 | [From Digital AI to Physical](./lesson-2-digital-to-physical.md) | 30 min | 1 | The paradigm shift from ChatGPT to walking robots |
| 1.3 | [The Humanoid Landscape](./lesson-3-humanoid-landscape.md) | 45 min | 1 | Key players: Tesla Bot, Figure, Unitree, Boston Dynamics |
| 1.4 | [Sensor Systems](./lesson-4-sensor-systems.md) | 60 min | 1 | LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, and force/torque sensors |

## Key Concepts

### Physical AI
AI systems that:
- Operate in the real, physical world
- Understand and respond to physical laws (gravity, friction, collisions)
- Use sensors to perceive their environment
- Use actuators to affect change in their environment

### Embodied Intelligence
The idea that true intelligence requires a body. A robot that has never experienced gravity cannot truly understand "heavy" the way you do.

### The Perception-Action Loop
```
Sensors → Perception → Decision → Action → Environment → Sensors...
```

## Hardware Note

:::info Tier 1 Compatible
All lessons in this chapter are conceptual and theory-focused. No special hardware required - just your laptop and curiosity!
