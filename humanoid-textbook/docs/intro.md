# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This 13-week course takes you from understanding large language models to building and deploying humanoid robots that move through the physical world.

## What You Will Learn

Across four modules, you will progress through the complete Physical AI stack:

- **Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System**: Master ROS 2 middleware, build nodes, services, and actions for robotic control
- **Module 2 — The Digital Twin**: Simulate humanoid robots in Gazebo and Unity with realistic physics
- **Module 3 — The AI-Robot Brain**: Develop perception pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac for visual SLAM and navigation
- **Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action**: Integrate large language models with ROS 2 for voice-controlled robot actions

## Getting Started

Begin with **Module 1** to set up your development environment and build your first ROS 2 package. Every lesson includes a Tier 1 path that works with any laptop and a web browser — no special hardware required.

Choose your starting point from the sidebar, or jump straight into [Module 1: ROS 2](/docs/module-1-ros2).
